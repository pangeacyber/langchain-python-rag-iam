# Code of Conduct for Public Events

## Croquet-Ground Rules

1. The Queen Always Wins - It's the Queen's game.
1. The Queen Never Loses - If the Queen loses, see Rule #1.
1. Use Flamingos as Mallets - No exceptions. Flamingos must be treated properly; if they refuse, it's your fault.
1. Hedgehogs as Balls - Hedgehogs are to be rolled gently, or else.
1. No Cats Allowed - Any cats, particularly the Cheshire Cat, are strictly forbidden as they disrupt gameplay with their vanishing and reappearing antics.
1. "Off with Their Heads!" Applies - Any form of disobedience or error may lead to immediate execution. Stay alert!
